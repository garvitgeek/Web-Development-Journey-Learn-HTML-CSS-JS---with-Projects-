                    ISRO, the Indian Space Research Organisation, is the space agency of the Government of India. Founded in 1969, it focuses on space research and exploration, satellite development, and <br>launching missions for both national and international clients. Some of its notable achievements include the Chandrayaan missions to the Moon, the Mars Orbiter Mission (Mangalyaan),
                    <br> and a series of satellite launches that support telecommunications, meteorology, and navigation. ISRO is recognized for its cost-effective approaches and has made significant contributions to space technology and science.</p>
                


                    <h2>Recent Missions</h2>

                    <h3>Chandrayaan-3</h3>

                    <p>India achieved this historic milestone on August 23, 2023, with its Chandrayaan-3 mission. The spacecraft, comprising a lander and a rover, successfully landed near the lunar south pole, marking a significant achievement in space exploration.

                        This feat is particularly noteworthy as the lunar south pole region is considered a challenging and unexplored area, with permanently shadowed craters that may hold frozen water and other vital resources for future astronaut missions.
                        
                        India’s Chandrayaan-3 mission demonstrates the country’s technological capabilities and its commitment to advancing space research and exploration. This achievement solidifies India’s position as a major player in the global space community, joining an elite group of countries that have successfully landed spacecraft on the moon.</p>


                    <h2>Upcoming Missions</h2>    

                    <h3>Gaganyaan</h3>

                    <p>

                        Gaganyaan project envisages demonstration of human spaceflight capability by launching crew of 3 members to an orbit of 400 km for a 3 days mission and bring them back safely to earth, by landing in Indian sea waters.
                        
                        The project is accomplished through an optimal strategy by considering inhouse expertise, experience of Indian industry, intellectual capabilities of Indian academia & research institutions along with cutting edge technologies available with international agencies. The pre-requisites for Gaganyaan mission include development of many critical technologies including human rated launch vehicle for carrying crew safely to space, Life Support System to provide an earth like environment to crew in space, crew emergency escape provision and evolving crew management aspects for training, recovery and rehabilitation of crew.
                        
                        Various precursor missions are planned for demonstrating the Technology Preparedness Levels before carrying out the actual Human Space Flight mission. These demonstrator missions include Integrated Air Drop Test (IADT), Pad Abort Test (PAT) and Test Vehicle (TV) flights. Safety and reliability of all systems will be proven in unmanned missions preceding manned mission.
